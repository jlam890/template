# Overview

The majority of the student body at UH Manoa commutes to school. Parking is one of the biggest issues and needs of the community. Students who do not have a parking pass usually need to chance it with the parking structure and when they see that sign "Lot Full" they have wasted their time and gas driving just to be denied. Then they must waste their time to find another place to park.

Our solution Manoa Stalls, allievates this problem by crowd sourcing the resources from our community. Students who log on to our application will be able to help out their fellow peers with valuable information regarding parking. The application runs a shared database which has tips and location information on parking spots for students. 

# Mockup Page Ideas

Here are the pages included in the application:
1. Welcome/Login Page
2. Report or Search Page
3. Report Page
4. Search Page

# Use Case Ideas

There are many different situations where Manoa Stalls is applicable. For example, student A parks his car in the structure and sees that there is plenty of space on floor 3. He can log on to Manoa Stalls and let other students know that parking is available on floor 3. In another example student B is running late for class and needs to know where the closest available spot for her car is. Opening up Manoa Stalls and choosing the search feature lets her see the nearby open spots as reported by her fellow peers.
