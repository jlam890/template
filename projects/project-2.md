CatTracks is a android platform application that my team and I developed for a 24 hour hackathon. CatTracks allows the user to create and name their own cat to take care of. This cat has five different stages of life and whenever the user goes over a threshold of time on social media the cat's life deteriorates. Right now the threshold is set for 10 seconds for demo purposes. There is also a section where the user can go to see their usage stats. The second page is a bar graph of the time used for the sites snapchat, instagram, facebook, and twitter.

My role in the team was understanding and implementing the function that would poll the android system for the amount of time used by the social media apps. I also designed the bar graph page with the amount of time on social media displayed. Both of these tasks were challenging because they involved using new android libraries and we only had the 24 hour time limit to understand the library and then implement the functions.

From this project I learned how to import a new library into an android project. The library we used to build the bar graphs were actually from an outside source and not a part of the android apis.
